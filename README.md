# 📉 Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project tackles a real-world business problem faced by telecom companies: reducing customer churn and its impact on recurring revenue. Using Python, logistic regression, and decision tree modeling, I simulate actionable strategies for retention, target segmentation, and campaign planning.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Identify key churn drivers using customer behavior and demographics
- Build predictive models to flag high-risk customers
- Quantify lost revenue potential and simulate retention campaigns
- Deliver visual insights via Python plots and executive-style storytelling

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Classification metrics, decision tree visualizations
- Business scenario simulation and campaign ROI

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customers with short tenure and high monthly charges are most vulnerable
- Contract type and lack of online support services strongly correlate with churn
- Decision tree model achieved 75% precision; logistic regression enhanced probability scoring
- Retention targeting logic can save up to 246 missed churners, recovering revenue monthly

  ## 🔍 What I built:
- Logistic regression & decision tree models to predict churn risk
- Segment-level insights using Python visualizations
- Revenue loss estimates and campaign targeting logic for retention
## 💡 Key Results:
- Decision tree achieved 75% precision identifying at-risk customers
- Simulated retention campaigns for 246 high-risk users, with potential monthly revenue recovery
- Clear churn patterns by contract type, tenure, and service usage


## 💼 Business Impact
By predicting churn and simulating intervention strategies, this analysis supports marketing and customer success teams with proactive decision-making.

## 📝 Portfolio Use
